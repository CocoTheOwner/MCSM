# Minecraft Server Manager
A manager for using many different server versions
 
## Install
To install download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/CocoTheOwner/MCSM/releases/latest).

# Running
Just doubleclick the executable.
You can also input a few command line inputs. Documentation for that can be found when adding the `-h` flag when you run the executable from a terminal.
Lastly, after running the executable, a `settings.toml` file will appear in the directory. You can edit this to get full customization.
